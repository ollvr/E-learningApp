This is a simple e-learning app build with vue as front-end technologie and laravel in backend
for database i used mysql
i used vue + pinia in state managment 
and i used token for securing api
i implement a simple charts because i don't have real data to analyse
it and genrate stats so i used chart js library to generate fake charts
